You have 21 units of transparent aluminum alloy (TAA), LazWeld1, a joining robot leased for 23 hours, and CrumCut1, a cutting robot leased for 17 hours of aluminum cutting. You also have production code for a bookcase, desk, and cabinet, along with commitments to buy any of these you can produce for \$18,  \$16, and  \$10 apiece, respectively.  A bookcase requires 2 units of TAA, 3 hours of joining, and 1 hour of cutting, a desk requires 2 units of TAA, 2 hours of joining, and 2 hour of cutting, and a cabinet requires 1 unit of TAA, 2 hours of joining, and 1 hour of cutting. Formulate an LP to maximize your revenue given your current resources.


\begin{solution}

\noindent\medskip \underline{Sets:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The types of objects $ = \{$ bookcase,~desk,~cabinet$\}$.
\end{itemize}
\medskip \underline{Parameters:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Purchase cost of each object
\item Units of TAA needed for each object
\item Hours of joining needed for each object
\item Hours of cutting needed for each object
\item Hours of TAA, Joining, and Cutting available on robots
\end{itemize}

\noindent\medskip \underline{Decision variables:} \\
$x_i$ : number of units of product $i$ to produce, \\
for all $ i = $bookcase,~desk,~cabinet.\\

\noindent \medskip \underline{Objective and Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
\max \ \ & z = 18x_1 + 16x_2 + 10x_3  & \text{ (profit)}\\
s.t. \ \ & 2x_1 + 2x_2 + 1x_3 \le 21 & (TAA) \\
& 3x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 \le 23 & (LazWeld1) \\
&  1x_1 + 2x_2 + 1x_3 \le 17 & (CrumCut1)  \\
& x_1, x_2, x_3 \ge 0.
\end{align*}
