    You are a financial planner for an investment firm. The firm has \$100,000 to invest in a portfolio of projects. Each project has a projected return and requires an initial investment. The goal is to maximize the total return of the portfolio while not exceeding the available capital. The following table lists potential projects, their required investments, and their projected returns.
    
    Formulate an LP to maximize the total return of the portfolio while not exceeding the available investment capital.

    \begin{table}[h!] \begin{center} \begin{tabular} {|l|l|l|} 
    \hline Project & Investment Required (\$) & Projected Return (\$)  \\ \hline
    \hline  A & 20,000 & 30,000  \\
    \hline  B & 30,000 & 40,000  \\
    \hline  C & 50,000 & 75,000  \\
    \hline  D & 10,000 & 15,000  \\
    \hline  E & 40,000 & 60,000  \\
    \hline \end{tabular} \end{center} \end{table}
    
    
    \begin{solution}
    \underline{Decision variables:} \\
    $x_i$ : whether to include project $i$ in the portfolio, where $i \in \{A, B, C, D, E\}$, $x_i = 1$ if project $i$ is included, and $x_i = 0$ otherwise.
    
    \smallskip \underline{Objective and Constraints:}
    \begin{align*}
    \mbox{Max~~ } & z = 30,000x_A + 40,000x_B + 75,000x_C + 15,000x_D + 60,000x_E  \\
    \mbox{s.t.~~} & 20,000x_A + 30,000x_B + 50,000x_C + 10,000x_D + 40,000x_E \le 100,000 \\
    & x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D, x_E \in \{0,1\}.
    \end{align*}
    \end{solution}
