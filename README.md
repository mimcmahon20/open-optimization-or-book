# Mathematical Programming and Operations Research
## Modeling, Algorithms, and Complexity with Examples in Python and Julia
Edited by: Robert Hildebrand

This is part of the Open Optimization project - an ecosystem for open-source materials for teaching optimization and operations research.  This ecosystem is being formed to host open-source lecture notes, lecture slides, examples, code, figures, and textbooks on material and courses related to optimization.

All material other than code will be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) that permits free reuse and alteration of the material provided the proper attribution is given.  All material posted will be not just open-source, but open-source code as well - including LaTeX, tikz, and other means of generating content.  This allows those interested in reusing material an easy way to change and adapt the material as needed.

All code (e.g., Julia, Python, AMPL, GAMS, MatLab, etc.) on this repository will be licensed freely under the MIT License.  This is in an effort to make code simple and easy to reuse.
