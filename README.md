# Open Optimization (Prototype)
Welcome to Open Optimization - an ecosystem for open-source materials for teaching optimization and operations research.  This ecosystem is being formed to host open-source lecture notes, lecture slides, examples, code, figures, and textbooks on material and courses related to optimization.  

All material other than code will be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) that permits free reuse and alteration of the material provided the proper attribution is given.  All material posted will be not just open-source, but open-source code as well - including LaTeX, tikz, and other means of generating content.  This allows those interested in reusing material an easy way to change and adapt the material as needed.

All code (e.g., Julia, Python, AMPL, GAMS, MatLab, etc.) on this repository will be licensed freely under the MIT License.  This is in an effort to make code simple and easy to reuse.

Your contributions to this endeavor are greatly valued and appreciated.  We hope you will help with this project and also use it as a resource for future courses, lectures, and presentations.

Content posted here may be adapted into freely available open-source textbooks published through ???.  All contributors will be named in the acknowledgments section of any final publication unless they request to be removed. This attribution will include their name and institutional affiliation, and link to a profile or other professional site of their choosing.    Please see ____ as an example.

## Goals:
- Create freely available content to make easier teaching, designing courses, writing presentations, and finding reusable content.
- Create free textbooks for courses on optimization and operations research that are
- Modern (up to date with current techniques and approaches)
- Flexible (easy to adapt to the userâ€™s choice of presentation of material)
- Direct access to code examples (get students up and running faster)
- Community collaboration on content authoring and revisions
- Collect figures and images with source code for quality reproducibility
- Host instructive code for optimization
